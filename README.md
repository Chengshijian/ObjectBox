# ObjectBox
ObjectBox is a new superfast mobile database for objects. See the announcement for details:

[ObjectBox â€“ The new Mobile Database (Beta)](http://greenrobot.org/announcement/introducing-objectbox-beta/)

**Latest version: [0.9.9 (2017/03/07)](http://greenrobot.org/objectbox/changelog)**

This GitHub repo is a placeholder and will be extended in the future. Right now it serves to [track issues](https://github.com/greenrobot/ObjectBox/issues) with ObjectBox beta.

Beta Notice
-----------
ObjectBox is beta. That also means that, until we reach 1.0, there may be breaking changes. This applies to the API and also to the file format. The latter we will only change if we see really relevant changes that significantly improve ObjectBox. Please always check that you are using the latest version.
